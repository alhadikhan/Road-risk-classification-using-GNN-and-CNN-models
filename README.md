# Road-risk-classification-using-GNN-and-CNN-models
We experimented on Road Images(POV of the Driver) to classify between risky and safe roads using GNN and CNN models.
Graph Neural Network(GNN) in image classification is different than CNN
We first needed to convert the image into graph(.gpickle)
We used Canny Edge Detection and Keypoints extraction to make it into a graph which has only nodes and edges then we use different gnn models
we also modified gcn model to make it better
